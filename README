run: . setup_todo
to setup the todo.cfg environemnt variable to use the todo.cfg for
this project

to reload map:
  #map read ta.map 

netcat (as a server) for testing:
  nc -k -l 9090

#delay --> creates a delay object which executes in the specified amount of time, and then returns immediately!
  -- using #delay in a foreach does not delay the next steps, but rather creates
     multiple delay objects that will all execute at about the same time


Result:
  can't use while (since can't add a delay between actions), 
  instead, try action, and on failure continue, set a delay to
    call same action again (tail recurse)

Current scripting:
  #cursor echo on
  #read arena2b.tt
  #read <char>.tt
  #read health.tt
  ra

  #ali hs #read health.tt
